Image Scan
==========

Image processing / graphics project in JavaScript and Matlab.

# Project for TDT4195
This project involves taking an image, finding out where different objects of the same color is. Afterwards find the dead center for these objects. When you have the centers, make a 3D scene with the objects on the given centers. Same colored objects should be same 3D model. Each color should have a different 3D model.

# How it works
You upload an image and tell what colors the different objects are. You will get a `colors.txt` file that you need to read in matlab with our script. This script will output a `data.txt` file.

Drop this `data.txt` file to our site, and you will be presented a 3D scene in WebGL.
